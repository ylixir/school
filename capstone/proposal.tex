\title{Capstone Proposal}
\maketitle
For my capstone project I will be studying Markov bases under the guidance of Dr. Trevor McGuire. Markov bases are a tool used in algebraic statistics and algebraic geometry. I will most likely start by looking at the relationship between Markov bases and numerical semigroups. Dr. McGuire has helped me to identify a few sources that will get me started on my studies. I have attached a list of these.
