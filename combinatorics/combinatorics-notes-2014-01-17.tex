findstat.org

area of dyckpath is how many complete "blocks" you can fit under the dyckpath

\section*{our project}
in groups of 3 or 4 we are gonna take one of the different kinds of objects on findstat.org, find some statistics that aren't in there and submit them. basically generate the objects in sage, then submit them to findstat. there is also a wiki component that needs to be filled out.
