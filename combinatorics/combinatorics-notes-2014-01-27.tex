\section*{11}
set of 3 integers from 1 to 20 without consecutive integers

total minus all three minus 2 and one not
$\frac{20!}{17!3!}-18-$
\section*{17,18}
from last time, placing four rooks on chessboard so they don't attack

pick one spot, removes row and column, pick another, again removes row and column this is wrong $64*(64-15)*(64-15-13)*(64-15-13-11)$

or pick 4 rows and 4 columns $\left(\begin{array}{c}8\\4\end{array}\right)$ for both
multiply by the ways to place 4 rooks on a 4x4 board which is 4!

but our rooks have colors! two white, two black
once you place the rooks, count the ways to color them: $\left(\begin{array}{c}4\\2\end{array}\right)$

\section*{50}
so pick the two corners of the rectangle, place 2 non-attacking rooks, this defines two more, and pick the last square for the 5th rook
$\left(\begin{array}{c}8\\2\end{array}\right)^2\cdot60$

\section*{setup for permutations}
placements of $n$ non-attacking rooks on and $n\cross n$  is a bijections of the permutations of $\{1,2,...,n\}$

permutations of 1,2,3 are:
123,132,213,231,312,321

this is lex order

lets define a bijection of 4 rooks on 4x4 board, for each row, record the column of the rook. there are many ways of doing this, different countries do it differently.

\section*{algorithm in chapter 4 for generating permutations}
question: how can we list all the permutations of $[n]=\{1,...,n\}$ 

answer: we need an algorithm

another choice:(johnson, trotter...) ~1960

inductive idea: construct permutations of $[n]$ by inserting $n$ in all possible ways into the permutations of $[n-1]$.

algorithm: p91

sage has Permutations(n) command
