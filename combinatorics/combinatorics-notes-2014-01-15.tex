will be working in sage, brush up on python.

\section*{tools for counting}
problem 1
standard young tableaux (SYT) 2xn
recurrence relations
problem 2
non-crossing (perfect) matching of 2n
rotational symmetry or more generally symmetry
problem 3
Dych path of length 2n
problem 4
binary parenthezations
problem 5
triangulations of (n+2)-gon

we want a bijection to map these objects
for 3<->4 /<->( and \<->)
for 1<->2 top row must be smaller of pair and similarly bottom row corresponds to larger number in the pair
conditions for increasing in columns is the same as non crossing line condition
for 2<->3<->4 smaller number is up or left, and greater is down or left

these are all catalan objects
the number of catalan objects of size n is $\frac{1}{n+1}\left(\begin{array}{c}2n\\n\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{n+1}\cdot \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!}$
