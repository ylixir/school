For the record, the homework that is due today (1/23/15) is section 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 13, 18, and section 1.2 6a, 6b, 7, 10, 15.


For section 1.1, numbers 4, 11 and 18 are the three hardest, with 4 probably being the hardest (IMO).  I consider these to be 'challenge' problems, meaning that I don't necessarily expect perfection on them; it is okay to not have them complete.  Likewise for number 15 of section 1.2.


For next week, the homework for section 1.3 is 1,2,3,9,13, and for section 2.1 (we are omitting 1.4), 1,2,3,6,11.  In section 1.3, the hardest problem is a tie between 1 and 13, but they are not conceptually difficult per se, it is more that the proofs would be challenging.  Try to keep 'rambling' in check when writing those proofs.  A challenging 'bonus' question for section 1.3 would be to prove the inequality I put on the board at the end of class concerning the girth of a graph.  For section 2.1, the challenge problem is 6.  For number 11, the definition of antipodal is on page 37.
